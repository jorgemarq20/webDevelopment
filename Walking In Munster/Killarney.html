        <p>While the area lures mountaineers and mountain bikers who like a challenge, this walk takes you along a marked route using the Old Kenmare Road, a disused green road. The 12-mile route will require a reasonable level of fitness, good hiking equipment and waterproofs.</p>                             

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p>With most walks in the National Park, it's as well to be accompanied by a guide or at least well prepared with maps and compasses - it's very easy to stray a long way off the beaten track. Our walk, organised by Walk Killarney, began from the car park at Muckross House, with easy paths along the shore of Muckross Lake. Signs directed us towards the Kerry Way and Torc Waterfall. We climbed steep steps up the side of a waterfall, continuing through woodlands until we reached Torc Old Bridge. </p>

        <p>From here, we followed the Kerry Way signs to the left, which brought us onto open heath land at Crinnagh Glen and continued into Esknamucky Glen between the shoulder of Cromaglan Mountain and Stumpacommeen. Here, the road narrows into a bridle path over mountain and bog, reinforced with railway sleepers. The walk then descended through the twisted, mossy oakwoods of Ullauns Wood, famed for their lichens and mosses and home to the elusive pine marten. Turn left at the T-junction, following the Kerry Way signs along another stretch of rocky road. </p>

        <h2>What To Bring ?</h2>

        <p>As a general rule, it is best to be over-prepared than under-prepared. Waterproof and windproof clothing are essential and strong walking boots are also advised. Walkers should carry enough food and water for the walk and for emergencies as well as a first aid kit. You are also advised to inform someone of your intended route before you leave.</p>

        <h2>The Backdrop</h2>

        <p>The Kerry Way was created more than 20 years ago: a 135-mile, low-level, waymarked walking route over old droving paths and coach roads, taking in woodlands, valleys and coastline. The Old Kenmare Road is the first section of the Way and takes in the formal gardens of Muckross House as well as the mountains and sessile oakwoods of Killarney National Park. The start lies on the geological fault line known as the Millstreet to Muckross fault.</p>

        <p>In the 18th century, Killarney become something of a tourist mecca, attracting famous names. The footpath that leads up the side of the 60-foot Torc waterfall - home of the rare Killarney fern - takes in magnificent views of the Killarney lakes.</p>

        <p>In Crinnagh Glen, the furrows and stone walls of a pre-famine village provide a stark reminder of harsher times. Stones had been gathered up and left in piles, clearing the land for cultivating the potato crop - the shape of the ridges indicates the last crop never left the ground. The highest point of the route is at Windy Gap, between the mountains of Peakeen and Knockanaguish, 330 metres above sea level, followed by a descent that will command stunning views of Kenmare Bay and the highlands and islands beyond.</p>

        <p>Sharp-eyed walkers may spot peregrine falcon or merlin, and the area is known as the home of the bank vole, which was first identified in north Kerry in 1964 and has now expanded into the National Park.</p>

        <p>Walk Killarney is running a series of group walks marking public holidays - the next are the challenging Paps of Danu walk on Easter Saturday, the difficult Tower to Torc route on the Sunday and a half-day loop walk through Muckross Peninsula and Dinis Island on Easter Monday.
