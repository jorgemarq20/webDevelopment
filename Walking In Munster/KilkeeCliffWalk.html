<p>This circular walk begins at the Diamond Rocks Café at the West End of the town of Kilkee and follows a cliff path along the outstanding coastline.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>The Kilkee Cliff walk is a scenic 2 to 3 hour (8km) moderate loop walk along the Kilkee Cliffs starting the Diamond Rocks Café, Pollock Holes car park. This stunning walk starts from the unmissable natural swimming pools known as the Pollock Holes and passes great places of interest, a natural amphitheatre carved into the cliff face by formed by the waves over thousands of years, a natural blow hole in the rock face known as the Puffing Hole and next arriving at Intrinsic Bay, named after a ship which sank along with all 14 people on board in 1836.</p>

<p>From here you start the return journey with a moderate to steep climb before joining the main road back to Kilkee. For a short, 4 kilometre walk, turn left here and head back towards Kilee town. For this 8 kilometre loop walk, turn right along the coast until you come to a left turn. This road has beautiful views over the town coming down Moveen Hill taking you back to Kilkee.</p>

<h2>What To Bring ?</h2>

<p>It is never wrong to be over-prepared! We recommend waterproof/windproof clothing and strong walking boots. Always have more food and walk than you need in case of emergencies and, of course, a first aid kit is essential for the walk. Please inform someone your intended route before you leave.</p>

<h2>The Backdrop</h2>

<p>During the early part of the 19th century, Kilkee was just a small fishing village but in the 1820s when a paddle steamer service from Limerick to Kilrush was launched, it began to attract visitors. On 30 January 1836 the Intrinsic, a ship from Liverpool bound for New Orleans, was blown into a bay near Bishops Island in Kilkee. The shipwreck site is now called 'Intrinsic Bay'.</p>

<p>A chartered passenger sailing vessel named the Edmond sank at Edmond Point on 19 November 1850. The ship was sailing from Limerick to New York City but was driven into Kilkee Bay by a storm. As the tide was very high, the ship was driven all the way to Edmond Point, where it split in two. </p>

<p>In the 1890s, Kilkee had a boom, when the West Clare Railway opened up to goods transport, improving commercial life in the area, as well as providing a relatively fast means of travel to and from the town. Many prominent people in society travelled to Kilkee including Sir Aubrey de Vere, Charlotte Brontë (who spent her honeymoon here), Sir Henry Rider Haggard, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In 1896, the Crown Princess of Austria visited the town.[12] The entertainer Percy French was a regular performer in the town and an incident on the West Clare Railway on the way to Kilkee prompted him to write the song "Are Ye Right There Michael". Although it has become more developed and modern in recent years, the town retains some of its 19th-century Victorian feel.</p>

<p>Along with bathing on the strand, swimmers can choose from the Pollock Holes, New Found Out and Byrnes Cove. The Pollock Holes, which is also known as Duggerna Reef, are three natural rock-enclosed pools, with water that is changed by every tide. This not only brings in fresh water, but replenishes the marine life in the many rock pools surrounding it. The diving boards at New Found Out allow for dives of up to 13 metres (45 feet) into the open sea. The annual diving competition is held at these boards.</p>
