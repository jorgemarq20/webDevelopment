        <h2>What To Bring ?</h2>

        <p>As a general rule, it is best to be over-prepared than under-prepared. Waterproof and windproof clothing are essential and strong walking boots are also advised. Walkers should carry enough food and water for the walk and for emergencies as well as a first aid kit. You are also advised to inform someone of your intended route before you leave.</p>

        <h2>The Backdrop</h2>

        <p>Tramore had been a small fishing village in 1600's when the Doneraile family set up an estate. Then in 1794 Bartholomew Rivers, a wealthy merchant from Waterford built a hotel overlooking the bay. This hotel marked a milestone for the development of Tramore the town itself, as a thriving resort .</p>

        <p>Tramore has been a popular holiday destination now for 200 years as it is built on steep hills rising up from the beach. Tramore has continued to expand and is now one of the leading resorts in Ireland with its vast selection of amenitites.</p>

        <p>Initially the town flourished as a tourist destination, attracting visitors from as far away as Dublin in summer and from closer to home all year-round. As the population grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, Tramore became a satellite and dormitory town of Waterford City, situated some 13 km to the north. Today the town is a popular destination for surfing and other water sports.</p>

        <p>The scenic landscape of Tramore, represented by the strand and cliffs, attracts many walkers. Walks in the locality include the Doneraile Walk, Cliff Road Walk, as well as the 5 km Strand walk commonly called 'down the back and up the front'.</p>
